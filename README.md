## ‚ú® Hi there!

Welcome to the repository of Animo's Self-Sovereign identity demo. This interactive app demonstrates the use of verifiable credentials. This demo is built using [Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript). AFJ is a framework written in TypeScript for building SSI Agents and DIDComm services. This demo uses the REST API, which is part of the [Aries Framework JavaScript Extensions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext) repository.

### üñ• Client

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` file and set the environment variables.

```bash

| `REACT_APP_HOST_WEBSOCKET` | Used in the frontend application to connect with the WebSocket server and listen for events. Should be `ws://localhost:5000` for development. |

### üéõÔ∏è Server

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` file and set the environment variables.

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AGENT_PUBLIC_DID_SEED` | Used in the backend application for the agent. Should be set to your agent's public DID in development/production. |
| `AGENT_ENDPOINT`        | Used in the backend application for the agent. Should be set to your agent's endpoint in development/production.   |
| `AGENT_WALLET_KEY`      | Used in the backend application for the agent. Should be set to your agent's wallet key in development/production. |

### Node version

```bash
nvm use
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Tests

The demo has [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) integration tests. To run the tests, make sure you have both the client, server and test agent running locally. You can do this by running the commands `yarn dev` in the root of the project. You can then start the tests with `yarn test`. This will open up cypress in chrome from where you can run the tests.
